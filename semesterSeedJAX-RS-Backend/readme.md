        <li>Create a project folder somewhere on your systems and clone the seed from here: <a href="https://github.com/Lars-m/semesterseedfall2016.git">https://github.com/Lars-m/semesterseedfall2016.git</a> </li>

        Architecture
      </uib-accordion-heading>

      <p>This Version of the Seed provides a Java JAX RS Backend</p>

      <div class="col-md-8">
        <ul>
          <li>As usual all Backend Code should be placed in the <em>Source Packages</em> Folder</li>
        </ul>

        Backend Architecture
      </uib-accordion-heading>
      <p>This should come as no surprise to you.</p> 
      <p>It's a basic Maven Web Project with a few Demo REST Services included  + support for Token-based Security</p>
      <p>The seed also includes a few RESTAsured test, that demonstrates how to start an embedded Tomcat Server, and how to test REST-services that requires authentication</p>
      <br/>
    </uib-accordion-group>

      <uib-accordion-group heading="Security Features in the Seed" >
      <h3>Test Users: (logon with these credentials to test authentication)</h3>
      <p>The Backend supports whatever roles you come up with. Out of the box the front-end only handles the roles "User" and "Admin". Adding more is however simple</p>
      <ul style="font-size: large">
        <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:7em;">User</b>username = user, password = test</li>
        <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:7em;">Admin:</b>username = admin, password = test</li>
        <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:7em;">User+Admin:</b>username = user_admin, password = test</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Using the Security Features in this seed - <em>Server:</em></h3>
      <p>Decorate your REST classes and or methods with theese annotations: <em>@PermitAll</em> <em>@DenyAll</em> <em>@RolesAllowed</em>
      <p>See the section Securing RESTful Web Services Using Annotations here: <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24329_01/web.1211/e24983/secure.htm#RESTF256">Securing RESTful Web Services</a>
      <P>See The server package <b>rest</b> provides examples of services using both the <em>User</em> and <em>Admin</em> Roles</p>
      <p>Username, password, and roles are hardcoded in UserFacade.java and the User Class (your task is to place this info in a database)</p>

   <uib-accordion-group heading="Backend Testing" >
      <p>The seed ships with the necessary maven dependencies and plugins to use <a href=" http://rest-assured.io/">REST-Assured</a> and provides a 
        utility class <code>test.utils.EmbeddedTomcat</code> to assist in setting up an embedded Tomcat for your integrations tests.</p>
      <p>See the <code>test.InitialSeedRestIntegrationTest</code> class for an integration test example. Right-click this file from within NetBeans and select <em>Test file</em> to see test results in NetBeans</p>
      <p>Open a terminal, and navigate to the root of the project, and type: <em>mvn â€“verify</em> to see the test results generated by the failsafe-plugin (in the <em>target/ failsafe-reports</em> folder) </p>

    <uib-accordion-group heading="Exercises" >
      <h2>Exercise</h2>
      <h3>Adding the missing REST integration Tests</h3>
      <p>Todo --> Remove some of the tests and them as an exercise here</p>
      <h3>Make a new page</h3>
      <p>Get to know the internals of this seed. Look at the "Adding new files" section.</p>
      <p>When you have done that, make a view 5, that has a page and JS just like the other 4 views.</p>
      <h3>Make a database to persist the users</h3>
      <p>This seed does not have any database attached to it. If you look at the "UserFacade.java" you can see that right now, the users are stored in a Hashmap.</p>
      <p>Your task is to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make User.java an entity by introducing the proper annotations</li>
        <li>Make a database</li>
        <li>Use the wizard to make the persistence.xml (the wizard will put it the right place)</li>
        <li>Make your facade use the newly created database instead of the HashMap</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Don't care about the security right now, we will deal with that in the next point:</p>
      <h3>Make the password hashed and salted</h3>
      <p>Having plain-text passwords in your database is the worst rookie mistake you can make (But even <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/06/sony-hacked-yet-again-plaintext-passwords-posted/">Sony</a> did this and is a rookie)</p>
      <p>If you want to read a little bit more about hashing and why it is important, then <a href="https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm">Crackstation</a> got you covered</p>
      <p>For a better rant: <a href="http://plaintextoffenders.com/faq/devs">Plaintextoffenders</a> also has a good FAQ </p>
      <h5>Tasks</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Download the PasswordHash java file from the <a href="https://github.com/defuse/password-hashing/blob/master/PasswordStorage.java">Crackstation website</a></li>
        <li>Put it in the security package</li>
        <li>Check that it has the right package on the top</li>
        <li>Before persisting, call PasswordHash.createHash(password);</li>
        <li>Store the String you get in return</li>
        <li>Whenever a user tries to log in, evaluate the password sent with the hashed and salted one stored in the database by issuring: </li>
        <li>PasswordHash.validatePassword(password, wholeHash)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Important, commit and push to your own repository and use THIS VERSION, with a database for the rest of the semester</h4>
      <h3>Add another role</h3>
      <p>Make a new role for your new page: members. Members needs to have access to both view2 and your newly created view5</p>
